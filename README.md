## Inspiration

One of our team member's have always wanted to created a game where every time you refresh it changes the layout of the image. Finding this hackathon gave us inspiration to create a game that when you refresh you get a different layout every time.

## What it does

When the player refreshes the page, the layout of the image changes. The sun doesn't move but the sunbeams change sizes when the player refreshes. The clouds, trees, rocks, leaves and the river spawn in a different part of the screen.  


## How we built it

We built this project using JavaScript on code.org. We used Sprite lab on code.org. Each member of our team had a part of the forest that they had to code on their own, using the turtle tab. After each member was done we put it all together. The key is that everytime the page is refreshed an item of the forest in drawn in a different place within its x and y coordinates.  

## Challenges we ran into

Since we are beginners to coding, it was difficult to code the drawings individually. But what was more difficult was putting all the drawings together. It was a mess there bugs everywhere. But eventually after a couple of tries we will got all the drawings to work the way they were supposed to.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the mistakes we made. Take river for example we did not plan it to spawn the way it does but hey, it still works. the river was supposed to be a straight line going downwards  with the mountains on the top.

## What we learned

We learned that making mistakes is okay! Although there were a lot of bugs in our program, everything turned out to better than we expected.


## What's next for ScenYou

Given that we didn't have enough time for this project because we started late, a button that would spawn different layouts of the forest would be our next goal. After that our next goal would be to create a dropdown with options with different image options.
